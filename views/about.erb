<h1><a name="PlayLab">Play Lab</a></h1>
<p>Play Lab is a playgroup program designed to nurture the curiosity and creativity inherent in young children. Our goal as educators is to create an environment that promotes exploration of concepts and ideas, giving children the space to create and problem solve independently. Curriculum in the Play Lab classroom is not teacher directed or project driven, but will be molded by the interests of the students. Ultimately, the program was developed to support the scientific and artistic curiosity of each child, with teachers acting not as controlling leaders, but as guides and mediators of independent growth.</p>

<p>As educators, we will also foster a sense of community within the fabric of students and their families. Play Lab is constructed as an open classroom setting, and once children are settled we encourage parents to participate fully in the classroom. We will also offer workshops on relevant child care and wellness subjects throughout the year as a parental resource.</p>

<p>Most importantly, Play Lab is a safe space that will help each child gain confidence and exposure to the critical skill of socializing amongst peers. They will be given the language and tools to problem solve independently and collectively with other children. This dynamic will be achieved through a mixed aged classroom, an environment that we feel is more organic and which enhances collaborative learning amongst children. Play Lab is designed to teach the whole child and create a loving introduction to the school environment. In fact, the playgroup will provide appropriate tools so children can be transitioned easily and directly into local public schools.</p>
